# Learning Java

This repository is dedicated to organizing Java courses, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced topics. The goal is to centralize resources for an effective and structured learning experience.

## **Structure**
Instead of creating a new repository for every lesson or course I found—which would be impractical—I decided to consolidate everything into this repository.  
- The **main folder** remains unchanged, serving as a general directory.  
- Additionally, I created another repository called `javaph` to store courses from platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and other certificate-oriented platforms.  
- This repository, however, focuses more on free resources like YouTube and other open platforms.

## **Subfolders**
Each subfolder within this repository represents a specific course taught by different professionals, allowing for better organization and access to diverse perspectives.

## **Objective**
To provide a progressive and structured approach to learning the Java language, helping learners move seamlessly from basic concepts to advanced topics.
